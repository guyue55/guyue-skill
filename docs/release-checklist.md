# Release Checklist

This project should not be released just because the repository is clean. Release only when installation, verification, safety, and examples are all understandable to a new user.

## Positioning

- [ ] README says Guyue is a Personal Agent Operating Layer, not a complete autonomous person.
- [ ] README explains who should use it and why they should install it instead of asking an agent ad hoc.
- [ ] README links to installation, security, and evaluation docs.
- [ ] Skill count is consistent across `README.md`, `skills_manifest.json`, and `skills/`.

## Installation

- [ ] `docs/installation.md` covers Codex.
- [ ] `docs/installation.md` covers Claude Code.

## Showcase
